    <h2>About Rex and Rollo</h2>
    <p>My two little puppies, or at least they once were. Maahn how times change.</p>
    <p>Just the other day I got my to little lovely puppies,</p>
    <p>they were so small they could both sit in your lap and fit comfortably.</p>
    <p>They was so small and adorable, they were the talk of the estate,</p>
    <p>my two little mix-breed German Sheperds.</p>
    <p> Its funny how people done change man, two months down the line my two litthe guys are both so grown and musculine,</p>
    <p>the entire estate is now all so terrified of them, yet they're so social, I doubt they could even hurt a fly.</p>
    <p>Anyway, long story short, right now I'm being told they can't stay, that I have to move them upcountry because them neighbours are terrified.</p>
    <p>It really sucks doesn't it?</p>
    <h2>What do they like?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Chew toys</li>
      <li>Running and chasing each other in open fields</li>
